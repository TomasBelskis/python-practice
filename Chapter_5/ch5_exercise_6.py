@Description: Write a function which is given an exam mark, and it returns
              a string â€” the grade for that mark â€” according to this scheme:
              The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals.
              A closed interval in- cludes the number, and open interval excludes it.
              So 39.99999 gets grade F3, but 40 gets grade F2. Assume

              xs = [83, 75, 74.9, 70, 69.9, 65, 60, 59.9, 55, 50,
                     49.9, 45, 44.9, 40, 39.9, 2, 0]

              Test your function by printing the mark and the grade for all the elements in this list.
