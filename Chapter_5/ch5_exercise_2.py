@Description: You go on a wonderful holiday (perhaps to jail,
              if you donâ€™t like happy exercises) leaving on day number 3 (a Wednesday).
              You return home after 137 sleeps. Write a general version of the program
              which asks for the starting day number, and the length of your stay, and it
              will tell you the name of day of the week you will return on.
